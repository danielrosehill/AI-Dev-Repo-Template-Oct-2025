# Directory Map For: Claude Guidance Files

Every project starts with an idea!

The user will capture that in: project/kickoff/idea

- If it's idea.md - that's the idea!
- If it's idea.mp3, or an audio binary, you should STT the idea

This idea may be something of a scratchpad and require you to process it. The steps for how to do that will follow.

You MAY (or may not!) also find a more formal outline of the user's envisioned spec and choice of stack including AI tooling like MCP.

- If that exists, it will be here: project/spec/initial/starting-spec.md
- If it doesn't exist, you should create the starting spec from the idea
