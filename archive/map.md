# Directory Map For: Archive Area

This is the storage area for deprecated code, outdated documentation, and notes that are no longer actively used but may be useful for reference.

## Structure

- **code/**: Archived code files and implementations no longer in use
- **docs/**: Outdated or superseded documentation
- **notes/**: Old notes and planning materials

**Note**: Before archiving, consult with the user. Some materials may be better deleted entirely rather than archived.
