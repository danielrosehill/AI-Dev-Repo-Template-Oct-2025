# Directory Map For: First Entry

This is the base level for first entry - a temporary staging area for unsorted content.

## Purpose

Use this directory when you're not sure where to put things in the repo. It serves as a flexible intake area for:
- Content that needs categorization
- Scratchpad materials from the user
- Files awaiting proper organization

## Structure

- **for-ai/**: Files provided by the user for the AI to process (inputs)
- **from-ai/**: Output generated by the AI that hasn't been moved to its final location (outputs)

The user might also send scratchpad content here for sorting and organization later. This is a temporary workspace - files should be moved to their appropriate permanent locations when their purpose becomes clear.
